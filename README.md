# Sybil centrality hiding
Code related to the paper "Sybil Attacks on Centrality Measures" M. Waniek.

The code is provided as a Java Eclipse project.

* The **sybilcentrality.RunDensitySybilHiding** class allows to run density experiments.
* The **sybilcentrality.RunSybilHiding** class allows to run experiments with hiding heuristics.
* The **sybilcentrality.RunRealLifeSybilHiding** class allows to run experiments with real-life covert networks.

The results of the experiments are saved in the output folder.
